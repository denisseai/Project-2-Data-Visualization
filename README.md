## Getting Started
### Prerequisities
To use Matplotlib for your initial set of visualizations, you’ll need to install it using pip, a module that downloads and installs Python packages.
**On Windows**
To install matplotlib on Windows you'll first need to install Visual Studio, which will help your system install the packages that matplotlib depends on. Go to https://dev.windows.com/, click Downloads, and look for Visual Studio Community. This is a free set of developer tools for Windows. Download and run the installer.

Next you'll need an installer for matplotlib. Go to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib/ and look for a wheel file (a file ending in .whl) that matches the version of Python you’re using. For example, if you’re using a 32-bit version of Python 3.5, you’ll need to download matplotlib-1.4.3-cp35-none-win32.whl.

If you don't see a file matching your installed version of Python, look at what’s available at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib. This site tends to release installers a little earlier than the official matplotlib site.

Copy the .whl file to your project folder, open a command window, and navigate to the project folder. Then use pip to install matplotlib:
```
> cd python_work
python_work> python -m pip install --user matplotlib-1.4.3-cp35-none-win32.whl
```
